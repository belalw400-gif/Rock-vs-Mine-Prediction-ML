# 🚀 Rock vs Mine Prediction | Binary Classification

### 📝 Project Overview
This project is a Machine Learning solution developed to distinguish between **Rocks** and **Naval Mines** using sonar frequency patterns. This application is vital for undersea navigation and safety.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Algorithm:** Logistic Regression (Chosen for its efficiency in binary classification)

### 🧪 Methodology (PACE Framework)
I followed the **Google Advanced Data Analytics** PACE framework:
* **Plan:** Analyzed the sonar dataset consisting of 60 frequency bands.
* **Analyze:** Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and class balance.
* **Construct:** Trained a Logistic Regression model with a 90/10 train-test split.
* **Execute:** Validated the model's predictive power on unseen data.

### 📊 Key Results
* **Training Accuracy:** ~86%
* **Statistical Rigor:** Applied statistical principles learned from Andrew Ng’s specialization to ensure model reliability and proper data handling.

### 📁 Repository Structure
* `model.ipynb`: Full Python code and analysis.
* `Sonar data.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing.
* `Requirements.txt`: List of necessary Python libraries.
